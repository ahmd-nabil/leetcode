### Why can't we use n > 0?

- The binary representation of Integer.MAX_VALUE is 0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111, and 
- the binary representation of Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 is 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 (spaces added).
```
Note that the leftmost bit here denotes the sign of the number, but recall that we're told to treat input as unsigned.
```

Integer.MAX_VALUE is 2147483647, and Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 is -2147483648.
Intuitively, we would agree that -2147483648 has 1 one.
However, if our test is n > 0, -2147483648 fails that test, so we don't count any 1s, and instead incorrectly return 0.


### Why can't we use n >>= 1?
The assumption of this code is that, starting with a 32-bit binary number, 
we can move the bits over to the right, filling in zeros from the left.
```
So a few shifts of Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 should look like this:
0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

The operation that describes that kind of shift is the unsigned shift (also "logical shift") operator, denoted by >>>.

The operation denoted by >> is indeed also a shift (the "signed" or "arithmetic" shift), 
but not the shift we're looking for (since it fills in whatever the sign bit is, either 0 or 1)

A few shifts of Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 using the >> operator would look like this:
1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
1110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
1111 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
...
1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111, to infinity, which would never exit our n != 0 condition.
```
